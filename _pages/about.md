I am a Scientist and Engineer with a PhD in Biomedical Engineering and several years of experience developing intelligent perception technologies for robotic and image-guided systems. My work focuses on transforming complex sensor and imaging data into actionable information that supports real-time decision-making in high-precision environments.

During my PhD at Leiden University Medical Center, I designed and implemented machine learning and computer vision algorithms for surgical navigation, instrument tracking, and intraoperative imaging. I developed complete pipelines—from raw sensor data and video to robust, validated systems—enabling new ways to visualize, quantify, and improve human–machine interaction.

My mission is to bridge the gap between advanced technology and meaningful healthcare impact by translating intelligent algorithms into practical systems that improve clinical workflows and patient outcomes.
